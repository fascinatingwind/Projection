## For find projection of point C to a line AB (points A,B) need:\
Create matrix and point\
Our System of linear equation look like matrix M = P\
![Formula matrix M and point P](./MatrixM.svg)\
found det of M\
replace 1st column of M to point from P found det of Mx\
replace 2st column of M to point from P found det of My\
replace 3st column of M to point from P found det of Mz\

projection point will be \
{det(Mx)/det(M), det(My)/det(M), det(Mz)/det(M)}\

## Found a lambda parameter
